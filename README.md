## Issues
The API routes aren't layed out as well as I might have liked, some functionality needed to be in userRoutes in order to work, even though I wanted more of the backend stuff to be handled by the /api routes instead. I kept some api routes in the codebase because they have different returns (I.E. return a json instead of a handlebars render) and they're great for testing.
